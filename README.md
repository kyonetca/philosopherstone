PhilosopherStone (PHS) - PoS/PoW hybrid. Stones make more stones!

A descendent of Novacoin/PPCoin with hybrid Pow/PoS Stone generation (energy efficient).  

Philosopher Stones provide an annual interest rate of 50%. This equivalent to 3.44% monthly interest. PoS blocks will be generated if the Stones are held for more than 5-10 days. No special hardware needed

Other specifications:

   - Transaction fee destruction to benefit miners/stake holders. Increased # transactions = increased stone destruction
   - Each normal block has 64/32/(16) Philosopherstone
   - 2 minute block time
   - Difficulty re-targets every block
   - Mining payout will be halved every 3 months (or every 64800 blocks) (has happened twice)
   - Expected total mined coins will be 8,891,840 Philosopherstones (Much less due to PoS overtaking PoW)
   - 6 confirmations for transactions
   - 50 confirmations for minted blocks
   - Transaction messaging
   - Proof of Stake hybrid - Stones will mine themselves every 5-15 days
   - no need to spend tons of electricity, just run client once every week, sync and stake!

- Random bonus blocks (on average, at current rewards):
- 1 Super-block of 128 Philosopherstones every day (1 in 720 chance)
- 1 Double-block of 16 Philosopherstones every hour (24 per day)
- When getting super-blocks, different images will displayed, see them below.

   - The default ports are 16281(Connect) and 16282(RPC).
